    intro: `Abhishek Rai is a software engineer who redefined the possibilities of campus placements. Known for his disciplined approach to competitive coding and deep understanding of computer science fundamentals, he prioritized consistent learning over fleeting trends. His dedication culminated in a record-breaking offer of approximately 50 Lakhs from Atlassian during his final year, setting a new benchmark for student achievement.\n\nTip for juniors from him: Being consistent, and not worrying about what others are doing helped me a lot. Pick up something, read about it, research about it, learn from multiple sources, read it again. Keep repeating till you've mastered it more than anyone else around. Do it for things which matter. Ignore the noise. Stick to a road map.`,

    intro: `From the historic landscapes of Rajasthan to the bustling tech corridors of Bengaluru, Yash Kothari's journey is a testament to the power of growth mindsets. While many engineers claim a lifelong obsession with code, Yash's path began with a healthy dose of apprehension. Having completed his early education at Cathedral High School and St. Josephs PU College, he entered the University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering (UVCE) with the belief that computer science was an intimidating, perhaps even insurmountable, challenge.\n\nHowever, UVCE became the catalyst for a profound transformation. What started as hesitation quickly evolved into a deep-seated passion for building scalable systems. Yash discovered that mastery isn't a prerequisite for starting—it is the reward for persistence. This realization that complex subjects could be conquered through dedication set the stage for a stellar career in software engineering.\n\nProfessional Evolution\n\nYash's professional trajectory highlights a consistent climb through some of the industry's most respected tech environments:\n\nAtlassian (2020 to 2024): Yash spent over four years at Atlassian, evolving from a Software Engineer to a Software Engineer II. During his tenure, he played a pivotal role in the transformation of the Marketplace platform, migrating from Scala-based monoliths to modern architectures. His expertise spanned across Java, Spring Framework, and Apache Spark, proving his ability to handle large-scale, mission-critical infrastructure.\n\nHirefly (2024–Present): Currently serving as a Senior AI Engineer, Yash has pivoted into the cutting edge of Agentic Systems and Large Language Models (LLMs). He is a core contributor to usetango.ai, an AI sales copilot designed to research, qualify, and personalize outreach at scale.\n\nToday, Yash stands as a Senior AI Engineer in Bengaluru, bridging the gap between traditional software engineering and the future of AI. His story serves as an inspiration to every UVCE student: demonstrating that initial fear is often just the precursor to lifelong mastery.`,
